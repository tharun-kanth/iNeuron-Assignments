    "#### 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans  - re.compile() is the feature responsible for generation of Regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms (Metacharacters) or to allow special characters (speical sequences) to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals. Hence, Raw strings are used (e.g. r\"\\n\") so that backslashes do not have to be escaped. In other words, Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The return value of re.search(pattern,string) method is a match object if the pattern is observed in the string else it returns a None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - In the Regex r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)' the zero group covers the entire pattern match where as the first group cover (\\d\\d\\d) and the second group cover (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\)."

    "#### 7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - If the regex pattern has no groups, a list of strings matched is returned. if the regex pattern has groups, a list of tuple of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The | character signifies matching \"either, or\" between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - ? characters represents zero or one match of the preceeding group in regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - In regular expressions, the + matches one or more while * matches zero or more.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -  The \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space characters respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\w – Matches a word character <==> [a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\d – Matches digit character <==> [0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\s – Matches whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\W – Matches any non-alphanumeric character <==> [^a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\D – Matches any non-digit character <==> [^0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\S – Matches any non-whitespace character\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - .* is a Greedy mode, which returns the longest string that meets the condition. Whereas .*? is a non greedy mode which returns the shortest string that meets the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - [0-9a-z] OR [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - We can pass re.IGNORECASE as a flag to make a noraml expression case insensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -  Dot . character matches everything in input except newline character .. By passing re.DOTALL as a flag to re.compile(), you can make the dot character match all characters, including the newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "#### '42'\n",
    "#### '1,234'\n",
    "#### '6,368,745'\n",

    "\n",

How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
